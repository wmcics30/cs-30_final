# Proposal 
a program that solves the maze. it should involve backtracking,
searching, and other basic algorithem factors. the machine is 
placed at the entrance of the maze and work its way to the exit.

the program seems hard and requires huge amount of learning on the 
algorithem. I will be spanding most of my time learning and 
pracicing the concept during the first half, and work on the actual
program afterward.

## Needs To Have
- ~a structre of puzzle, limiting machine's movement. basically
    the wall that tells the player its option of movement~
- ~a prexisting, hardcoded puzzle for the machine to solve~
- ~a way to begain and end the game~

## Nice To Have
- the program is able to generate the puzzle itself
- ~an interaction system that allows the human to play it~
- maybe generate different difficulty of maze for both the machine 
    and the player to play it
- a different mode, where the machine is placed in the middle 
    of a maze and tring to find the only exit of the maze.
- ~fining the shorteset route~
- ~custome mode~
- sound effect
- better UI
