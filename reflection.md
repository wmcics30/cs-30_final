# Project Reflection- Maze

## Path Finding
- Finding the most efficient path from the start point to the end point is probably the most best part of this project. I have spend days learning algorithems and some of the basics that would help me came up with an algorithem that is able to do the job. The algorithem I used in this project is my favourite solution because it is much easier than the other backtracking methods. Although my solution is pretty bad in terms of time complexity, but it works.

## Time and Project idea
- time is a big issue that makes the project difficult for me. At one point my project is stuck because the time is too short for me to make the maze generator, but also too long for me to just hand it in. I had some trouble coming up with ideas that can make my project better while being able to hand it in on time. If I were to do a major project again, I would like to be more considerate on the project idea so it would fit better into the time frame and to prevent such awkward position.
