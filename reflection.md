# Project Reflection- Maze

## Path Finding
Finding the most efficient path from the start point to the endpoint is probably the best part of this project. I have spent days learning algorithms and other basics that might help me develop an algorithm that can do the job. The algorithm I used in this project is my favourite solution because it is much easier than the other backtracking methods. Although my solution is pretty bad in terms of time complexity, it works.

## Time and Project idea
time is a big issue that makes the project difficult for me. My project is stuck because the time is too short for me to make the maze generator and too long for me to hand it in. I had some trouble coming up with ideas that can make my project better while handing it in on time. If I were to do a major project again, I would like to be more considerate on the project idea to fit better into the time frame and prevent such an awkward situation.
